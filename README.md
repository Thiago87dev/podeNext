#### Important Note:

This project uses information and images from the Pok√©mon API to display data about different Pok√©mon. However, due to restrictions, Pok√©mon images were downloaded and incorporated locally into the project.

To facilitate the process of obtaining images, I developed a simple Python script that automatically downloads images from the Pok√©mon API. This script loops through the desired Pok√©mon and downloads the corresponding images directly to the project directory.
